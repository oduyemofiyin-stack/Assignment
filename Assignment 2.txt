4a.Version control is a system that tracks changes to code, documents, or digital content over time.
 It allows collaboration, change tracking, and reversion to previous versions.
 This helps teams work efficiently and maintain a record of changes.
As a frontend developer, version control is essential when working with a team because:

1. Collaboration: Version control enables multiple team members to work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts.
2. Change tracking: It tracks changes made by each team member, allowing you to identify and resolve conflicts.
3. Version management: You can easily revert to previous versions if something goes wrong, reducing errors and downtime.
4. Accountability: Version control provides a record of changes, making it easier to identify who made changes and when.

By using version control, frontend developers can work efficiently,
 collaboratively, and with confidence, ensuring high-quality code and minimizing errors.

4b.To use version control from your workspace:

1. Initialize a Git repository: Run git init in your project folder.
2. Add files: Use git add <file> or git add . to stage files.
3. Commit changes: Run git commit -m "<message>" to commit changes.
4. Link to remote repository: Use git remote add <name> <url> to link to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub).
5. Push changes: Run git push <remote> <branch> to upload changes.
